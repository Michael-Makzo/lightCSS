## Motivation

Having gone through many processes of  **repeatedly writing  the same or similar CSS codes**  every time I want to start a new project, I realized that I needed to build:
1.  A library that helps me set up **responsive layouts**  so I can  **focus**  more on what I want to build;

2. A library that provides me with a basic form of any  **component**  (like slideshows, tooltips, dropdowns, accordions, etc) that I need at a particular moment which I can easily modify to suit my needs;

3. A library that provides  **abbreviations** for common CSS properties  I can  **use and reuse**  instead of  repeating those properties every time.

4. A library that unifies all the functionalities listed above to prepare the basic setup of our designs and UI components.
This will make you and I to **use them as a  foundation**  and  **build upon it**  when developing interactive web sites.

## Features

*  **Ready-made fluid grid containers** that  **preserves**  the  **proportion**  of your elements and give you  **superpowers**  to display your page  **responsively** .

*  **Short forms** of commonly repeated **CSS properties**  are available for you to  **write codes quickly**  in a smart way.

*  **Ready-made UI components**  built using  **CSS only** , and in few cases,  **short lines of JS**  is required. This  **boosts the speed**  of your page dramatically.
