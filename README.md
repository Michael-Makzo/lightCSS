## Features

It allows you to:

*  Write **short forms** of most commonly repeated **CSS properties**

    SCSS
   ```scss
   
   .list {
        @include dib;
        @include tac;
        @include ttc;
   }
   ```
   
   CSS output
   ```css
   
   .list {
        display: inline-block;
        text-align: center;
        text-transform: uppercase;
   }
   ```
   
   This is also made simpler with HTML classes
   
   ```HTML
    <li class="d-block tac ttu">Meet with Susan</li>
   ```


*  Use **Ready-made responsive grids** and focus more on your page's look


*  Use **ready-made UI components**  built using  **only CSS**  (except in few cases where **short lines of JS**  is required. This  **boosts the speed**  of your page dramatically).


* Easily extend the mixins and enjoy  **great flexibility**.
